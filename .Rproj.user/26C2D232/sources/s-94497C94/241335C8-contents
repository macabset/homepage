" This is where I need to be  
  This is what I want to do  
  This is who I really am  
  This is my home."  
  
It may not be the best way to introduce myself by quoting a poem which I do not know who wrote it. It was told to me by a fellow dancer who was about to perform alongside me. What she said when we were seventeen stayed in my mind although the author wasn't so lucky. I carry it with me to remind me that it is all that matters. This is where I need to be.

Right now where I am is in Helsinki, Finland. I've lived here my whole life, although that's about to change. Next August it will be Kazan, Tatarstan. You can read all about it in my blog.

I'm also a student in University of Helsinki. Right now I write my masters thesis from History about unemployment benefits from the 1980's in Finland. Al though it is a pain in the ass and I lose my night's sleep and feel rather agitated, this is what I want to do. You can read what else I have done in my virtual CV (coming soon).

Who am I? I don't know, but what I can say is, I'm worth getting to know to. Find out with me.

This is my home (page).
